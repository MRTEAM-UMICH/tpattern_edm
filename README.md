# tpattern_edm

This repository contains the **Appendix materials** for our EDM 2026 submission on interpretable multimodal temporal (T-)patterns in a VR cardiac-arrest resuscitation simulation.

## Appendix contents
The appendix provides supporting documentation for the VR simulation setup and the analysis outputs:

- **Scenario stage labels**  
  A table describing scripted scenario “phases” (stage labels), including the encoded rhythm/state, the algorithm branch (shockable vs. non-shockable), and the typical training focus.

- **Clinical roles and data labels**  
  A table summarizing the four VR team roles (team leader, CPR provider, defibrillator operator, airway manager), their responsibilities, coordination focus, and the corresponding role marks used in training/data logging.

- **Original event codes (action & speech)**  
  A table listing the original action and speech event codes extracted from the VR simulation logs (preserved exactly as recorded), with semantic names and brief descriptions.

- **Representative THEME T-pattern visualizations**  
  Example T-pattern analysis visualizations generated with **THEME** for both expert and novice teams to illustrate stage-wise temporal patterns and group-level differences in team coordination behavior.

## Notes
- These materials are provided to improve transparency and reproducibility of definitions, labeling, and example outputs used in the paper.
- Dataset files may be excluded depending on privacy/IRB restrictions.
